# RSS Feed

The blog RSS feed is served at `/rss.xml` and generated by `src/pages/rss.xml.ts`.

## Contents

- Channel metadata: title, link, description, language, Atom self-link, Dublin Core namespace
- Items: title, link/guid, pubDate, description (summary), categories (tags), author (Jason Holt), `content:encoded` (full HTML content)

## Configuration

- Absolute URLs rely on `site` in `astro.config.mjs`. This repo sets `site: 'https://jasonholtdigital.com'`.
- Cache headers: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300` in the response.

## Feed Discovery

- Blog pages include `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="/rss.xml" title="Mythic Blog" />` in the head for automatic discovery by feed readers.
- RSS icon appears in:
  - Footer social icons (site-wide)
  - ShareBar component (on individual blog posts and resources)

## Full Content

The feed includes the complete markdown content of each post via `content:encoded`. While HTML would be ideal, Astro v5's `render()` function doesn't easily expose compiled HTML strings. Most modern RSS readers handle markdown formatting well, providing a good reading experience.

If you need HTML in the future, consider using a markdown-to-HTML library like `marked` or accessing the rendered HTML through other means.

## Author Information

Each post includes `<dc:creator>Jason Holt</dc:creator>` using the Dublin Core namespace for better feed reader compatibility.

## Summaries

The `summary` field in blog post frontmatter is used for the RSS `<description>` element. This field is required in the blog content schema (`src/content/config.ts`). Write a concise 1-2 sentence summary when creating new posts.

## Customizations (optional)

- Add per-post author fields if you introduce multiple authors to the blog.
- Include hero images as `<enclosure>` elements for richer feed items.
