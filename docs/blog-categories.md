# Blog Categories

Categories are used for grouping posts and generating category pages.

## Allowed categories

The allowed categories are enforced by the blog collection schema:

- Release Notes
- Behind the Scenes
- Guides
- Community
- Announcement

To add a new category, update the enum in `src/content/config.ts` and the metadata map in the category page.

## Category slugs

Category page URLs are generated by lowercasing and replacing spaces with dashes:

`/blog/category/<category-to-lowercase-with-dashes>/`

Example: `Behind the Scenes` â†’ `/blog/category/behind-the-scenes/`

## Category metadata

Per-category description and icon live in `src/pages/blog/category/[category].astro` (the `categoryMeta` object).

If you add a category, also add an entry with a short description and a site-consistent icon (Font Awesome Slab/Brand). Keep labels concise.
