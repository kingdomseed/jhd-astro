# JHD Website Copy & Voice — Product‑First v5 (Mythic GME Hub)

> **Why this update**
>
> We’re shifting the Jason Holt Digital website to be the **official hub for Mythic GME 2e apps** (mobile + desktop). The site should feel focused, quiet, and player‑first, with a small "maker’s note" about the developer. Any employer‑facing or portfolio content becomes secondary (About/Blog), not a co‑equal goal on the homepage.

---

## 1) Executive Direction

- **Single purpose:** Convert visitors into players and community members.
- **Primary actions:** **Download**, **Join Discord**, **Get support**, **Learn the basics**.
- **Tone:** Calm confidence, craft‑forward, community‑centred. Short sentences. Minimal jargon on the homepage.
- **Structure:** Hero → Screenshot billboard → Social proof strip → 4 benefits → Community & Support → Resources teaser → Maker’s note → Footer.
- **License clarity:** Prominent, quiet **OFFICIAL LICENSEE** bar (dismissible). Link to Word Mill Creative.

---

## 2) Brand Pillars

### Internal Philosophy (What we embody)
- **Craft & cadence** — Small, steady improvements; quality over noise.
- **Clear & quiet** — Friendly voice, restrained visuals, no hype.

### External Messaging (What we communicate to players)
1. **Official** — Licensed Mythic GME 2e companion apps.
2. **Player‑first** — Speed to story: ask, roll, move on.
3. **Story flow** — Remove friction from adventures, enhance creativity.
4. **Community‑driven** — Features shaped with players (Discord, reviews).
5. **Inclusive experience** — Whether starting out or seasoned veteran.

> **House line:** *GM‑less play at your fingertips.*

**Key principle:** We don't talk to players about our development craft—they experience the results of it through smoother storytelling.

**🏆 GOLD STANDARD:** The homepage (`src/pages/index.astro`) is our gold standard for design quality, voice, user experience, and component implementation. All other pages should match or aspire to this level of polish and intentionality.

---

## 3) Voice & Tone

- **Default voice:** Helpful, direct, friendly. Avoid marketing fluff. Avoid over‑explaining.
- **Focus:** Talk about player outcomes (faster stories, smoother adventures, enhanced creativity) not development process.
- **Pronouns:** Use **we** on product pages; use **I** in the Maker's Note.
- **Rhythm:** Player benefit → action. Keep lines scannable. One idea per sentence.
- **Technical depth:** Keep it out of the homepage. Move deep dives to **Resources/Blog**.
- **Craft philosophy:** Internal compass only—players experience the results, not the process.

**Microcopy patterns**

- Buttons: **Download Now**, **Get Mobile**, **Get Desktop**, **Join Discord**, **Support & FAQ**
- Stats: **4.7★ avg rating · 5k+ installs · 2k+ community members**
- Social proof: One‑line quotes with a source and link.

---

## 3.1) Brand Typography

**Primary fonts**

- Display: Epilogue (700/800/900) — hero headlines, punchy statements, buttons/CTAs.
- Body/UI: Plus Jakarta Sans (400/500/600/700) — body copy, small headings, navigation, UI labels.

**Usage rules**

- Keep Epilogue for short, high‑impact lines. Avoid long paragraphs in Epilogue.
- Use Plus Jakarta Sans everywhere else for readability and calm tone.
- Button labels use Epilogue (heavy weight) to match the neo‑brutalist styling.
- Page titles may stay in Plus Jakarta Sans unless a page needs extra punch.

**Implementation (CSS tokens)**

- Tokens: `--font-display` = Epilogue stack; `--font-body` = Plus Jakarta Sans stack.
- Applied: `body { font: 16px/1.65 var(--font-body) }`, `.display-title { font-family: var(--font-display) }`, `.btn { font-family: var(--font-display) }`.
- Delivery: Google Fonts with `display=swap`. Consider preconnect to fonts domains if needed.

**Do**

- Keep lines short in Epilogue, increase letter‑spacing slightly if you tighten sizes.
- Use consistent weights per context (e.g., 900 for hero title, 800 for buttons).

**Don’t**

- Don’t mix Epilogue and Plus Jakarta Sans within the same sentence.
- Don’t use Epilogue for dense or lengthy body content.
