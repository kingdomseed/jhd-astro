# About — Maker’s Note & Partnership

## Maker’s Note
Hi, I’m Jason—an indie developer focused on tools that respect and amplify tabletop creativity. I build the **official Mythic GME 2e apps** in partnership with Word Mill Creative, and I ship small, steady improvements because craft matters. When players tell me a feature cut friction from their session, that’s the win. If that sounds like your kind of software, welcome.
