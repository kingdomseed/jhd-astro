        Hi, I’m Jason—an indie developer focused on tools that respect and
        amplify tabletop creativity. I build the <strong>official Mythic GME&nbsp;2e
        apps</strong> in partnership with Word Mill Creative, and I ship small,
        steady improvements because craft matters. When players tell me a
        feature cut friction from their session, that’s the win. If that
        sounds like your kind of software, welcome.
