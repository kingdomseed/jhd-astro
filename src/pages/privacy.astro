        <h2>Hi, I'm Jason</h2>
        <p>I built the Mythic GME apps because I love solo RPGs and wanted better digital tools for the community. Your privacy matters to me as much as it matters to you. This policy explains exactly what data I collect, why, and how you control it.</p>
        <p><strong>Jason Holt Digital LLC</strong> is the data controller for both Mythic GME Mobile and Mythic GME Digital. For any privacy questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@jasonholtdigital.com">privacy@jasonholtdigital.com</a></li>
          <li><strong>Data Protection Officer:</strong> Jason Holt (that's me)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Apps This Covers</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mythic GME Mobile</strong> — iOS, Android, macOS, and Web versions</li>
          <li><strong>Mythic GME Digital</strong> — Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop versions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Data I Actually Collect</h2>
        <p>I collect minimal data, and only what's necessary to make the apps work better. Here's exactly what I collect by platform:</p>

        <h3>Mobile Platforms (iOS, Android, macOS, Web)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Analytics (opt‑in):</strong> PostHog and Firebase capture app usage such as screen views, feature interactions, and events like dice rolls, table searches, list actions, settings changes, and support actions.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> app_version, platform, locale, build_channel, and current_screen; a pseudonymous per‑install identifier (PostHog distinct_id).</li>
          <li><strong>Context hashes:</strong> hashed IDs for journal, scene, table, and list context (SHA‑256 with a per‑install salt). No raw journal, scene, or table content is sent.</li>
          <li><strong>Derived metrics only:</strong> e.g., content length buckets, expression complexity flags, counts. We do not send your actual notes or journal text.</li>
          <li><strong>Crashes &amp; errors (opt‑in):</strong> Sentry captures crash/error reports and session replays (screen capture) to help debug issues. Text content is obfuscated/redacted, including static UI labels.</li>
          <li><strong>Country/region inference:</strong> Providers may infer rough location (e.g., country) from IP for product localization; precise GPS location is not collected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Desktop Platforms (Windows, Linux)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Analytics (opt‑in):</strong> Similar pseudonymous usage analytics as mobile when enabled.</li>
          <li><strong>No advertising IDs:</strong> Desktop builds do not use mobile advertising identifiers.</li>
          <li><strong>Local‑first:</strong> Journals, scenes, and custom tables remain on your device unless you export/share them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What I DON'T Collect</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
          <li>Precise location data (GPS coordinates, exact address)</li>
          <li>Your game content or journal entries</li>
          <li>Browsing history outside the app</li>
          <li>Photos, videos, or personal files</li>
          <li>Social media connections</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Analytics Choice</h2>
        <p>When you first open the app, you'll see a consent dialog that explains analytics and lets you choose. <strong>Analytics is off by default</strong> until you opt in. <strong>Crash and error reporting</strong> is <strong>on by default</strong> to help diagnose issues and keep the app stable. <strong>Session Replay</strong> is treated separately as described below. You can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enable or disable analytics any time in Settings (controls PostHog and Firebase).</li>
          <li>Disable crash/error reporting any time in Settings.</li>
          <li><strong>v1.5.3 and later:</strong> Enable or disable Session Replay any time in Settings. Replay sampling and upload follow your preference (off unless you turn it on).</li>
          <li><strong>Prior versions:</strong> On‑error Session Replay may be on by default; you can disable it in Settings.</li>
          <li>Keep using all app features even if analytics are off and/or crash reporting is disabled.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>I Don't Sell Your Data. Ever.</h2>
        <p>I don't sell your data. I won't sell your data. There's no business model here that involves selling data. The only scenario where your data might be "sold" is if I ever sold the entire business, and your data transferred with it as part of the app's functionality. But I'm not selling data to advertisers, data brokers, or anyone else.</p>

        <h2>How Your Data is Processed</h2>
        <h3>Analytics &amp; Diagnostics Providers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>PostHog</strong> (product analytics): collects pseudonymous usage events and properties listed above. <em>Session replay is not enabled</em> in PostHog at this time. Data is encrypted in transit. Region: United States. <strong>Retention (Cloud, paid):</strong> events retained up to <strong>7 years</strong>; session replay recordings retained for <strong>3 months</strong> by default (1 month on free). Some replays may be retained for up to <strong>1 year</strong> if pinned to a playlist, shared publicly, or added to a notebook. Sources: <a href="https://posthog.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="https://posthog.com/docs/data/keeping-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data retention docs</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (Google/GA4): receives mirrored usage events during migration for continuity. No advertising features are used. Region: United States (Google Cloud). <strong>Retention (GA4 default for free):</strong> user- and event-level data retained for <strong>2 months</strong> by default (projects can optionally extend some data to 14 months). <em>Planned removal:</em> GA4 mirroring will be removed after app version <strong>1.5.4</strong>. Source: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7667196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics retention</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Sentry</strong> (crash/error reporting + session replay): captures error details and short session replays to diagnose issues; text on screen is obfuscated/redacted and not readable. No keystrokes are captured. Crash/error reporting is enabled by default and can be disabled in Settings. <strong>Session Replay</strong>: <em>v1.5.3+</em> sampling follows your preference (off unless enabled). <em>Earlier versions</em> may have on‑error replays on by default; you can disable them in Settings. Region: United States. By default, Sentry SDKs mask all text and images in replays and do not record any sessions unless sampling is explicitly enabled. <strong>Retention:</strong> Sentry retains event data according to your subscription plan’s retention window and deletes regular backups after <strong>90 days</strong>. Exact durations vary by plan and data type. Source: <a href="https://sentry.io/security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentry Security</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> I configure provider-level retention to keep analytics and diagnostics data only as long as needed, then delete or aggregate it. See provider-specific retention above. You can request deletion at any time (see Your Privacy Rights).</li>
          <li><strong>International Transfers:</strong> Data is processed in the United States under appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs) where required.</li>
          <li><strong>Data sharing/sale:</strong> Data is not sold. Providers process data on my behalf to improve the app.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>

        <h3>Legal Basis (GDPR)</h3>
        <p>For users in the EU, my legal basis for processing is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a)):</strong> Analytics runs only if you opt in; you can withdraw consent any time in Settings.</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)):</strong> Crash/error reporting (including on‑error session replay) to maintain security and stability; and responding to support emails you send. You can disable crash/error reporting in Settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Privacy Controls</h2>
        <h3>In‑App Controls</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Settings → Analytics:</strong> Toggle analytics (PostHog/Firebase) on/off</li>
          <li><strong>Settings → Diagnostics:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Crash &amp; Error Reporting:</strong> On/Off (on by default)</li>
              <li><strong>Session Replay (v1.5.3+):</strong> On/Off (off by default)</li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>App Analytics:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Analytics &amp; Improvements → Share App Analytics</li>
          <li><strong>App Permissions:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Files and Folders → Mythic GME</li>
          <li><strong>App Tracking:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Tracking (though I don't track across apps)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Android</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>App Permissions:</strong> Settings → Apps → Mythic GME Mobile → Permissions</li>
          <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Settings → Google → Usage &amp; Diagnostics</li>
          <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Settings → Google → Ads (though I don't use ads)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Limited Analytics:</strong> Most device‑level controls don't apply</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Platform Differences</h2>
        <h3>Why Desktop Has Limited Analytics</h3>

          <li><strong>Windows/Linux:</strong> Firebase and PostHog have limited functionality on these platforms</li>
          <li><strong>macOS Desktop:</strong> Some analytics work, but less comprehensive than mobile</li>
          <li><strong>Technical Limitations:</strong> Desktop platforms don't support many mobile analytics features</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> Less data collection means better privacy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Mythic GME is designed for tabletop RPG players, who are typically adults. The apps are not intended for children under 13. Users must be at least 16 to consent to analytics processing in the EU, or have parent/guardian consent where applicable.</p>
        <p>If you believe a child has used the app and analytics were enabled, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@jasonholtdigital.com">privacy@jasonholtdigital.com</a> immediately.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The "Last Updated" date will change</li>
          <li>Major changes will be announced in the app</li>
          <li>You'll see the consent dialog again if analytics practices change significantly</li>
          <li>Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future Features</h2>
        <p>If I ever add cloud save functionality or other features that change data handling:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This policy will be updated first</li>
          <li>You'll be notified of changes</li>
          <li>New features will have their own privacy controls</li>
          <li>Existing privacy settings won't change without your consent</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Contact Me</h2>
        <p>For any privacy questions, concerns, or requests:</p>

        <h2>App Store Compliance</h2>
        <h3>Google Play Data Safety</h3>
        <p>This privacy policy supports Google Play Data Safety requirements by disclosing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data collected:</strong> App activity (feature interactions, screen views), App info &amp; performance (diagnostics where applicable), and Device or other IDs (pseudonymous per‑install ID). No personal or precise location data is collected.</li>
          <li><strong>Purposes:</strong> Product analytics and app functionality; no advertising.</li>
          <li><strong>Data sharing:</strong> Only with analytics providers (Firebase, PostHog) for processing on my behalf. Data is not sold.</li>
          <li><strong>Security practices:</strong> Data encrypted in transit; minimal collection.</li>
          <li><strong>User controls:</strong> Analytics is optional and controlled by an in‑app toggle.</li>
        </ul>
