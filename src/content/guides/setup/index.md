Welcome! This is a sample guide entry using the new `guides` collection. It demonstrates that:

- Images are optional (no hero or step images here).
- The page renders with the standard site header, page header, and footer.
- You can add content normally below the frontmatter.

Add your own content here. When you're ready to include screenshots, place them next to this `index.md` (e.g., `./hero.png`) and add the fields to frontmatter.
