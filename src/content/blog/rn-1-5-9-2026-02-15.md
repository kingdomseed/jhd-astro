Released on February 15, 2026

This one has been cooking for a while. The community asked for a way to jot down notes mid-session without leaving the adventure log — so now you can. Narrative Log Entries let you write free-form Markdown notes right alongside your fate rolls and scene events. That was the starting point, but the rest of the release grew from there: four new Crafter table packs with cascade linking, achievements on iOS and Android, a redesigned Fate Chart on mobile, and a bunch of fixes players flagged in Discord.

## Highlights

- **Narrative Log Entries**: Add free-form notes with Markdown support directly to your Adventure Log.
- **Adventure Crafter & Location Crafter Tables**: Two new table packs with cascade linking — rolling on Random Themes automatically rolls on the matching Plot Points table.
- **Creature Crafter Tables**: 30 tables for generating creatures on the fly — potency, size, classification, 10 creature description types, and abilities with interactive chain-rolling across 15 sub-tables.
- **Event Crafter Tables**: 10 new tables including Map Elements (100 keywords for building Mythic Maps, from Mythic Magazine #62), Fantasy Treasure, Mercenary Missions, and Quest Waypoints.
- **Updated Fate Chart** (mobile): Polished portrait layout with cosmic nebula Roll Fate button and left-handed mode; redesigned landscape layouts for Fate Chart and Meaning Tables.
- **Deep Search**: Search meaning table metadata (descriptions, categories, tags) with a new toggle in Settings.
- **Achievements** (iOS/macOS/Android): Unlock achievements on Apple Game Center and Google Play Games as you play — fate outcomes, random events, scene milestones, and more.
- **Journal Backup Restore**: View and restore journal backups directly from the journal list — see timestamps, file sizes, and restore with a single tap.
- **Android**: Edge-to-edge display, predictive back gestures, and native Material transitions.
- **Scene Copy/Export**: Copy a single scene or all scenes to clipboard for sharing with LLMs or note-taking apps.
- **Unlock Window**: See your 12-month unlock countdown directly in the Premium Features view.

## Added

- **Narrative Log Entries**: Tap the + button in the adventure log header to write a free-form note (up to 512 characters, with Markdown support) that gets added as a "Narrative" entry. Available on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Adventure Crafter Tables**: Random Themes, Plot Point Theme, Meta Plot Points, and 5 theme-specific Plot Points tables with cascade linking so rolling on Random Themes automatically rolls on the matching Plot Points table.
- **Location Crafter Tables**: Special Elements, Simple Question Odds, and Complex Question tables for Descriptions and Actions.
- **Creature Crafter Tables**: 30 tables for generating creatures — 4 core mechanic tables (Potency, Number of Creatures, Size, Classification), 10 creature description tables, 1 main Ability table, and 15 ability sub-tables with interactive chain-rolling via linked rolls.
- **Event Crafter Tables**: 10 tables for adventure generation — Special Elements, Event Elements (Concluding and Non-Concluding), Map Elements (100 keywords for building Mythic Maps, from Mythic Magazine #62), Fantasy Treasure (Minor & Major), Mercenary Missions (Objective, Reward, Twist), and Quest Waypoints (Challenge, Goal).
- **Deep Search**: New toggle in Settings to search meaning table metadata (descriptions, categories, and tags). When enabled, the tags filter panel also filters available tags based on the search query.
- **Scene Copy/Export**: Copy a single scene or all scenes to clipboard for easy sharing with LLMs or note-taking apps.
- **Journal Backup Restore**: Tap the overflow menu (⋮) on any journal to view available `.bak.1`/`.bak.2` backups with locale-aware timestamps and file sizes, or restore from any `.json`/`.bak` file on disk. Includes confirmation dialog and success/error feedback.
- **Achievements** (iOS/macOS/Android): Apple Game Center (iOS/macOS) and Google Play Games (Android) achievements — unlocks and incremental progress tracked for fate outcomes, random events, scene interrupts, scene milestones, and log entry milestones.
- **Unlock Window**: See your 12-month unlock countdown directly in the Premium Features view.
- **Focus Mode** (mobile): Hides images on mobile for a distraction-free experience.
- **Long-Press Odds** (tablet/desktop): Long-press odds buttons to quickly view target numbers.

## Changed

- **Fate Chart (Portrait, mobile)**: Polished layout — odds wheel and action buttons now sit in a 3:1 row (wheel left, buttons right), with left-handed mode swapping sides. Roll Fate button features a cosmic nebula background with pulsing glow animation; Random Event button uses subdued styling for clear visual hierarchy.
- **Fate Chart (Landscape, mobile)**: Redesigned as a 2-column view — game log on the left, controls on the right — replacing the previous 3-column layout.
- **Meaning Tables (Landscape, mobile)**: Redesigned as a 2-column view — search and table list on the left, permanent results panel on the right — replacing the draggable bottom sheet.
- **Android Edge-to-Edge** (Android): Migrated from immersive-sticky fullscreen to modern edge-to-edge display with transparent system bars. Status bar and navigation bar now overlay content seamlessly (ahead of Android 16 enforcement).
- **Android Predictive Back** (Android): Native predictive back gestures with in-app route transition animations. Android now uses its native platform behavior for page transitions, scroll physics, and back gestures.
- **iCloud Sync** (iOS/macOS): Replaced per-file sync status with an aggregate state machine that tracks all three repos and emits a single consolidated status — eliminates UI thrashing from rapid per-file cycles. Deferred table migration until after cloud repo is attached. Downgraded verbose per-file logs.
- **Clipboard Copy**: Extracted shared copy utility for consistent error handling and screen-reader announcements across the app.
- **Adventure Log**: Consolidated diverging copy-text builders into a single method, ensuring copy text and screen-reader announcements always match what's displayed.
- **Memoized Markdown**: Scene Markdown rendering is now memoized for smoother scrolling.
- **Performance**: Reduced freezes/hangs by deferring heavy table work and improving on-demand loading. Consistent loading spinners for Event Focus and Adventure Log.
- **iCloud Migrations** (iOS/macOS): Now use coordinated upload/download operations when moving data into or out of iCloud storage.
- **Dice Roller**: Renamed "Mobile Dice Roller" panel title to "Dice Roller" for consistency.

## Fixed

- **iCloud Sync Status** (iOS/macOS): Fixed Settings sync status showing "Available" instead of "Synced".
- **Copy Button**: Fixed visual feedback (green checkmark) not appearing after copying.
- **Category Icons**: Fixed built-in category icon customization not reliably updating.
- **Purchase Restore**: Added automatic purchase restoration on first launch after reinstall so returning users don't need to manually find "Restore Purchases".
- **Adventure Log (Colons)**: Fixed Meaning Table entries with colons in the table name rendering incorrectly.
- **Adventure Log (Copy Text)**: Fixed copy/accessibility text for Scene Check entries — roll type was incorrectly shown as "Random Event", and embedded random event details were missing.
- **Adventure Log (Double-Submit)**: Fixed a race condition on the narrative entry bottom sheet where rapid taps could create duplicate entries.
- **Windows**: Fixed "More Settings" button in panel settings closing the dialog without navigating to the full settings screen.
- **Adventure Crafter**: Fixed Plot Points tables to match the source material wording and ensured META results roll on the Meta Plot Points Table.
- **iPad Sharing** (iPad): Fixed export/share failures caused by missing share origin.
- **Undo**: Fixed a crash when tapping the Undo SnackBar action after deleting a scene.
- **Cloud Sync** (iOS/macOS): Malformed filenames/paths no longer crash the app.
- **Event Focus Import**: Invalid/malformed files are now treated as user-facing validation errors (not crashes).
- **Journal Import**: Invalid file types/invalid JSON handled as user-facing validation.
- **Dice Roller Import**: Saved formulas import now handles cancellation/invalid files gracefully.
- **Journals**: Eliminated duplicate storage call when loading journals.
- **Tables**: Fixed crash on table copy progress screen.
- General stability and performance improvements.
