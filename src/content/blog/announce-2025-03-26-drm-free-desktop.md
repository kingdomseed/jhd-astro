## üõ†Ô∏è Built With You, For You

> *"More than half our improvements come straight from the Mythic Discord. This isn‚Äôt my app ‚Äì it‚Äôs* our *app."* ‚Äì Jason Holt, Developer

One of the most exciting aspects of developing *Mythic GME Digital* has been the incredible feedback and suggestions from the Mythic community. Many features in the app today‚Äîand even more coming soon‚Äîare directly inspired by your input. Here‚Äôs how your ideas have shaped this project:

- Extensive Accessibility Support From screen reader compatibility to adjustable font sizes, colorblind mode, and left-handed operation, accessibility features were prioritized thanks to community requests for inclusivity.
- Expanded Meaning Tables The app now includes a massive collection of d100 meaning tables and event focus tables sourced from *Mythic Variations* and *Mythic Magazines*, fulfilling requests for more tools to inspire creative storytelling.

- Design Choices Based on Player Feedback Every aspect of the app, from layout to navigation, reflects decisions influenced by Mythicers‚Äô feedback. Your suggestions have helped me refine the user experience to better suit solo players, GM-less groups, and storytellers alike.
- Upcoming Features on the Roadmap Version 1.5 will introduce custom table creation‚Äîa highly requested feature that will allow you to tailor your experience even further. This is just one of many exciting updates inspired by community input.

Your feedback has been invaluable in shaping *Mythic GME Digital*. If you have ideas for future features or improvements, let me know through the Mythic Discord or the itch.io community pages. Together, we‚Äôre building the ultimate storytelling companion!

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Why Your Support Matters

When my wife and I committed to this full-time development journey last year, we set out to create tools that empower storytellers across desktop platforms:

- Lifetime updates for one price ‚Äì Buy once and enjoy ongoing support and updates across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Thanks to my wife‚Äôs support through her job, I‚Äôve been able to dedicate myself fully to developing *Mythic GME Digital*. Every purchase helps sustain this journey and ensures the app continues to grow with new features and improvements inspired by the incredible Mythic community.

Every purchase helps us:
