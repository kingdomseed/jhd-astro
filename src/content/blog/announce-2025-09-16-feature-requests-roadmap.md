I hope those of you who have it are enjoying version 1.5 with custom tables! I’ve launched a **feature request board** and a **public roadmap** for future work on the apps.

## Vote on features

There are currently **42 open feature requests**. The board lets you **vote** on what you’d like to see next so I can prioritize the work that matters most.

- Board: [feedback.jasonholtdigital.com/board](http://feedback.jasonholtdigital.com/board)

## Roadmap status

The roadmap isn’t fully filled out yet; I’ll flesh it out as I plan the next major releases. Expect something more concrete by the end of October.

## How to contribute

- Browse the open requests and see if your idea already exists.
- Add comments with your use case or variations you have in mind.
- If it’s new, submit a request and others can vote.

## What’s next

Work continues as we head towards **version 1.6**. Thanks for all your support!
