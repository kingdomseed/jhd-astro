I hope those of you who have it are enjoying version 1.5 with custom tables! I wanted to let the community know I’ve launched a **feature request board** and a **public roadmap** for future work on the apps.

There are currently **42 open feature requests**, and the new board lets you **vote** on what you’d like to see next. This will help set the direction for future work in terms of priority.

Board: https://mythicgmeapps.features.vote/board

The roadmap is not quite filled out yet, but I’ll be fleshing it out as I plan the next major releases. I hope to have something more concrete by the end of October.

If you’ve got an idea, have a look at the current open requests and see if yours fits somewhere. Feel free to jump into the discussion and add ideas or variations you have in mind.

Work continues as we head onwards to **version 1.6**! Thanks for all your support!
