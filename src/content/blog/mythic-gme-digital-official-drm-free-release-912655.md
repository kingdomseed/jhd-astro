<blockquote><em>&quot;More than&nbsp;half our improvements come straight from the Mythic Discord. This isn‚Äôt my app ‚Äì it‚Äôs</em>&nbsp;our&nbsp;<em>app.&quot;</em><br>‚Äì Jason Holt, Developer</blockquote>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of developing&nbsp;<em>Mythic GME Digital</em>&nbsp;has been the incredible feedback and suggestions from the Mythic community. Many features in the app today&mdash;and even more coming soon&mdash;are directly inspired by your input. Here‚Äôs how your ideas have shaped this project:
</p>
<ul><li>Extensive Accessibility Support<br>From screen reader compatibility to adjustable font sizes, colorblind mode, and left-handed operation, accessibility features were prioritized thanks to community requests for inclusivity.
</li><li>Expanded Meaning Tables<br>The app now includes a massive collection of d100 meaning tables and event focus tables sourced from&nbsp;<em>Mythic Variations</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Mythic Magazines</em>, fulfilling requests for more tools to inspire creative storytelling.
</li><li>Design Choices Based on Player Feedback<br>Every aspect of the app, from layout to navigation, reflects decisions influenced by Mythicers‚Äô feedback. Your suggestions have helped me refine the user experience to better suit solo players, GM-less groups, and storytellers alike.
</li><li>Upcoming Features on the Roadmap<br>Version 1.5 will introduce custom table creation&mdash;a highly requested feature that will allow you to tailor your experience even further. This is just one of many exciting updates inspired by community input.
</li></ul>
