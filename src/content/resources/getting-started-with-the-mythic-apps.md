Welcome! This quick guide is based on the app itself: you start at the Fate Chart and move between Lists, Scenes, and Meaning Tables as you play. There are no accounts or servers—everything happens on your device.

> What you need: Bring these to the table
> - Your favorite RPG and character(s) created (keep sheets handy)
> - The Mythic GME 2e book for odds and rules context
> - The desktop or mobile app installed

## Before you begin

 - A copy of the [Mythic Game Master Emulator 2e book](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/422929/mythic-game-master-emulator-second-edition) (Word Mill Creative) for rules context and guidance
- Your favorite RPG system and character(s) created and ready to play 
- The desktop or mobile version of the app

## Core steps

### 1) Install

Install the desktop app or the mobile app from your platform’s store and launch it. Once launched, the app automatically creates your first journal for you called 'My Journal'. You can rename this in settings.

### 2) Start at the Fate Chart (or switch to Fate Check)

On first launch, the app opens to the Fate Chart. You can switch the default to Fate Check in Settings later if you prefer. Set your Chaos Factor, choose odds, and roll. The app highlights Yes/No/Exceptional results clearly. 

> Tip: Change A Screens Settings
> - There's a settings wheel that let's you change the settings for each screen.
> - You can enable more details about rolls on the Fate Chart screen
> - You can also turn on the ability to ask a question before each roll

### 3) Core screens you’ll use every session

- Fate Chart (and Fate Check): ask questions, choose odds, roll, and interpret answers.
- Lists: track Characters, Threads, and Features. These lists feed your event rolls and bring elements into your story in unexpected ways.
- Scenes: jot a title and summary; snapshot the Chaos Factor for the scene start; add notes as you play or wait until the conclusion of a scene and summerize.
- Meaning Tables: Action/Subject and other tables for giving you the inspiration to interpret your results.

Layout notes
- Mobile: each area is its own screen; switch using the navigation drawer on the top left.
- Desktop: all core areas are visible together so you can roll and write without switching.

### 4) A simple first session flow

1) Set Chaos Factor (CF) in the Fate Chart
2) Create a Scene with a short summary; record the scene’s starting CF
3) Begin the scene by asking your first yes/no Fate question in the Fate Chart and roll
4) If you get stuck, roll on Meaning Tables for inspiration
5) Add items to Lists (Characters, Threads, Features) as they emerge
6) Adjust CF between scenes as your story shifts

## Tips & troubleshooting

- Unsure about how to start? Keep the book nearby and start with likely/50‑50 early on
- Chaos factor determines how likely exceptional results occur
- On mobile, try landscape when you want more context while playing
