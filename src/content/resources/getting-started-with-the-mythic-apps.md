Welcome! This quick guide is based on the app itself: you start at the Fate Chart and move between Lists, Scenes, and Meaning Tables as you play. There are no accounts or servers—everything happens on your device.

> Callout: Bring these to the table
> - Your favorite RPG and character(s) created (keep sheets handy)
> - The Mythic GME 2e book for odds and rules context
> - The desktop or mobile app installed (no sign‑in required)

## Before you begin

- A copy of the Mythic Game Master Emulator 2e book (Word Mill Creative) for rules context and odds guidance
- Your favorite RPG system and character(s) created and ready to play (keep character sheets handy)
- The desktop or mobile version of the app

## Core steps

### 1) Install

Install the desktop app or the mobile app from your platform’s store and launch it. Permissions are minimal; no sign‑in is required.

### 2) Start at the Fate Chart (or switch to Fate Check)

On first launch, the app opens to the Fate Chart. You can switch the default to Fate Check in Settings later if you prefer. Set your Chaos Factor, choose odds, and roll. The app highlights Yes/No/Exceptional results clearly.

### 3) Core screens you’ll use every session

- Fate Chart (and Fate Check): ask questions, choose odds, roll, and interpret answers.
- Lists: track Characters, Threads, and Features. These lists feed your events and oracles.
- Scenes: jot a title and summary; snapshot the Chaos Factor for the scene start; add notes as you play.
- Meaning Tables: Action/Subject and other tables for prompts when you’re unsure what happens next.

Layout notes
- Mobile: each area is its own screen; switch using the navigation drawer on the top left.
- Desktop: all core areas are visible together so you can roll and write without switching.

### 4) A simple first session flow

1) Set Chaos Factor (CF) in the Fate Chart
2) Create a Scene with a short summary; record the scene’s starting CF
3) Begin the scene by asking your first yes/no Fate question in the Fate Chart and roll
4) If you get stuck, roll on Meaning Tables for inspiration
5) Add items to Lists (Characters, Threads, Features) as they emerge
6) Adjust CF between scenes as your story shifts

## Tips & troubleshooting

- Unsure about odds? Keep the book nearby and start with likely/50‑50 early on
- If something feels off, lower CF; if chaos erupts, raise CF
- On mobile, try landscape when you want more context while writing
