Welcome! This quick guide gets you installed on desktop and mobile, signed in, and comfortable with the Mythic workspace. You’ll make a first entry and verify sync so you’re ready for adventures.

## Before you begin

- A Mythic Account (email/password)
- Internet access for initial sign-in and sync
- Optional: both a desktop and a mobile device if you want to test cross‑device sync

Tip: If you’re moving between platforms, keep the same account to keep everything in one place.

## Core steps

### 1) Install desktop and mobile

Download and install the desktop app. Then install the mobile app from your platform’s store. Launch the app and allow any requested permissions.

### 2) Sign in and enable sync

Go to Settings → Account and sign in. Ensure Sync is toggled on. If you’re on two devices, sign in on both using the same account.

### 3) Tour the workspace

- Journals: capture entries and attach roll outcomes.
- Dice Roller: presets, custom formulas, and collections.
- Custom Tables: build portable tables for improvisation.

Use the header navigation to jump between tools. Panels resize responsively; try a smaller window to see the compact layout.

### 4) Create your first entry

Create a journal entry titled “Session 0”. Add a couple of rolls using the Dice Roller and link them in the entry. Save the entry, then check your other device to confirm it appears after sync completes.

## Troubleshooting

- Sign-in fails or stalls
  - Double-check credentials and network. If the issue persists, sign out and back in.
- Nothing appears on the second device
  - Verify Sync is enabled on both devices. Make a tiny edit (e.g., add a word) and wait a few seconds.
- App feels sluggish on first run
  - This can happen during initial indexing. It should smooth out after a minute.

## Next steps

- Learn the Dice Roller deeper: formulas, presets, and collections.
- Build your first Custom Table and share it.
- Tips for sharing and safeguarding journals.
