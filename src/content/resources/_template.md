Intro paragraph. Explain what the reader will achieve and pre-reqs if any.

## Before you begin

- List any accounts, installs, or assets needed.
- Link to downloads or related resources.

## Core steps

Use the structured `steps` frontmatter above for images and concise copy. Keep the Markdown body for narrative, notes, and links.

### Tip: Images

- Place all images under `src/assets/resources/<your-slug>/`.
- Reference images in frontmatter (`hero`, `steps[n].image`) so they are optimized by `astro:assets` and rendered via `<Image />` in `resources/[slug].astro`.
- Always provide alt text when you include an image (schema enforces this for `hero` and each step image).

## Troubleshooting

- Q: Common issue here
  - A: Short resolution steps or link to support.

## Next steps

- Link to adjacent guides.
- CTA to Support or Discord if relevant.
