## Where to organize

- Open the Custom Tables feature through the navigation drawer or if on desktop, from the icon button on the right.
- Choose the categories tab.
- Categories, icons, and translations are managed alongside your tables.
> - Unlocking note: 
> - on Google Play, Amazon, and the Apple App Store, Custom Tables is an IAP; Itch.io and Microsoft Store include it with a higher‑priced purchase.

## Meaning vs Event Focus

- Meaning Tables: produce results like “Attack” or “Distant Location” and often chain to other tables
- Event Focus Tables: decide what kind of event happens (e.g., NPC Action), often the first roll in an event workflow

## Categories & icons

- Categories define icon, label, and sort behavior for table groups
- The app seeds built‑in categories from an asset file; you can reset to defaults if needed
- User categories live alongside the defaults; keep built‑ins untouched and add your own under the user categories area

Best practices
- Short display names; add detail in descriptions
- Swap in your prefered language. Portuguse has official support in the app (thank you Retropunk!) and I hope to offer more official language support for other languages as time goes on

## Tags and search

- Add tags to tables and entries to improve search and grouping
- Use consistent tags for adventure arcs, biomes, factions, tones, etc.

## Linking tables

- Set a link to another table or list for each entry in your table. from a specific result, immediately roll another table (or an Adventure List)
- Set a link to another table or list any time the table is rolled on. after producing a result, roll one or more follow‑ups
- Maxmium chained rolls are currently set to 10. Let me know if you think that should change.
