## Where to find Custom Tables

Open the Custom Tables feature through the navigation drawer or if on desktop, from the icon button on the right.
> ### How to Unlock
  >  - Google Play, Amazon, and Apple App Store: requires an in‑app purchase to unlock Custom Tables.
  > - Itch.io and Microsoft Store (Windows): included with the higher‑priced purchase.

## Make your first Meaning table

1) Open Custom Tables → New → Meaning Table
2) Name it and pick (or create) a category
3) Set the range (for a first table, try 1–10 or 1–20)
4) Add entries so the full range is covered without gaps or overlaps
5) Optional polish: description, tags, translations, icon
6) Save and test by rolling

> ### Tips
> - Start small (1d6/1d10) and expand later to 1d100
> - Keep ranges continuous (no gaps/overlaps). The app validates this for you
> - Use entryRollOn to chain results to other tables or to Adventure Lists (Characters/Threads/Features)

## Make an Event Focus table

1) Open Custom Tables → New → Event Focus
2) Range is typically 1–100 (percentile) but smaller ranges work too
3) Add entries that describe what kind of event happens (e.g., NPC Action, Thread Event)
4) Save and try a few test rolls

> ### Tip 
> Each Table can be linked or nested under another table an each entry can also be linked to or nested under another table to immediately roll on another table. You can also link Lists this way.


## Translations & metadata

- You can add per‑table and per‑entry translations as you go. Default language is `en`.
- Add tags to help search and grouping.
- Icons are configured via categories; you can pick an icon per category once and reuse it.
