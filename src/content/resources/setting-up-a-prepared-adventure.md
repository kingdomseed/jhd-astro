Playing a prepared adventure (like a published D&D module) with Mythic requires just a few simple setup steps. The app includes special features designed specifically for this play style.

## Step 1: Change Your Event Focus Table

The first thing you'll need to do is switch to the **Prepared Adventure Event Focus Table**.

1. Open **Settings** from the sidebar
2. Tap on **Event Focus Table**
3. Select **Prepared Adventure Event Focus Table**

This special table removes events that the published adventure already handles (like "Move Toward a Thread" or "New NPC") and adds **Adventure Feature** as a possible Random Event. This keeps Mythic from overriding the adventure's structure while still providing surprises and GM emulation.

## Step 2: Populate Your Features List

The **Features List** (shown in the Lists section) is where you'll track unique elements from your prepared adventure that could appear as Random Events.

Add items like:
- Wandering monster encounters
- Special environmental hazards
- Random visions or dreams
- Sudden NPC appearances
- Random encounter tables from the adventure
- Special mechanics (poison progression, pursuit by villains, etc.)

**Example:** In a vampire hunting adventure, you might add:
- "Vampire lord attacks"
- "Random vision"
- "Wandering monster"
- "Weather worsens"

When you roll **Adventure Feature** as a Random Event, you'll pick or roll from this list.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Other Lists

As you read the introduction of your prepared adventure:
- Add important NPCs to your **Characters List**
- Add plot hooks and objectives to your **Threads List**

This primes Mythic to generate Random Events that feel appropriate to the adventure's tone and setting.

## Important Notes

**Prepared Adventures use a modified scene structure:**
- Use Expected Scenes normally
- No Altered Scenes
- No Interrupt Scenes
- Random Events are added to Expected Scenes (not replacing them)
- Scene Adjustment is disabled by default

When you test an Expected Scene and roll within the Chaos Factor, generate a Random Event but continue with your Expected Scene. The Random Event adds a twist without derailing the prepared adventure.
