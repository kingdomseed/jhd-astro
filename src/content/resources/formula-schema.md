## Overview

This page documents the JSON format for Saved Formulas so your files can be validated and shared between devices or tools. For a practical walkthrough of saving, loading, importing, and exporting formulas from the UI, see [Saving and Managing Dice Formulas](/resources/saving-and-managing-dice-formulas/).

Plain English: You don’t need to know code to use this. “JSON” is just a structured text file the app reads and writes, and the “schema” is a rulebook for tools to double‑check that a file looks right. Most players can ignore the details below.

## Downloads

See the Downloads section at the bottom of this page for files.

Important: For now, do not rename the file. The app expects the filename to be `saved_formulas.json`. (Dice Bags will later allow custom names.)

## Format (canonical)

Saved Formulas are stored as a wrapped object:

- `formulas` (array): The list of saved formulas.
- `version` (string, optional): File version you maintain for your own tracking.
- `schemaVersion` (number): Format version used by the app (e.g., 1).

### Formula object fields

- `formula` (required string): Dice expression, non-empty.
- `name` (optional string): Display label; defaults to `formula` if missing.
- `description` (optional string): Extra context.
- `dateAdded` (optional ISO8601 string): Timestamp when created.
- `id` (optional string): Unique identifier (usually generated by the app).

### Minimal skeleton

```json
{
  "formulas": [
    { "formula": "2d6+3", "name": "Sword attack" }
  ],
  "schemaVersion": 1
}
```

### Compatibility

- Imports accept older shapes (a top-level array or a single formula object). The app normalizes to the wrapped format shown above when exporting.
