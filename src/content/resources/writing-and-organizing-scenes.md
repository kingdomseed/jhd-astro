The Scenes screen in the Mythic Apps is the hub of your adventure. It gives each chunk of play a clear container so you can set expectations, roll Fate, react to twists, and keep tidy notes as you go.

## Developing your scenes in the app

Scenes are the basic units of in‑game time that bring form and order to your story. Creating a Scene in the app locks in the context, sets the mechanical tempo (Chaos Factor), and gives you a focused place to write what happens.

### 1) Start the scene: expectations and Chaos

- First Scene: Your adventure starts with an opening scene that “gets the story rolling.” No Chaos test is needed.
  - Inspired idea: Use your concept for the opener.
  - Random inspiration: Use Meaning Tables to generate an opening prompt (Action/Subject) or roll a full Random Event (Event Focus + Meaning) to spark your start.

- Later Scenes: After the first, every new scene begins as Expected — how you think things will play out. Then test that expectation against the current Chaos Factor (CF 1–9).
  - If the roll is higher than CF: proceed as expected.
  - If the roll is ≤ CF and odd: the scene is Altered — tweak location, activity, or an NPC; go with the next most expected outcome.
  - If the roll is ≤ CF and even: the scene is an Interrupt — your expectation is ignored and a twist occurs. Generate a Random Event (Event Focus + Meaning) to define it.

Tip: You can switch your home view between Fate Chart and Fate Check in Settings. Either way, scenes log the outcome (Expected/Altered/Interrupt) in your notes.

### 2) Define the scene: name and description

- Name: Give the scene a short title so you can find it later.
- Chaos Factor: Set CF on the scene to the current value when the scene begins (you’ll adjust it after the scene ends).
- Description (supports Markdown): Use headings, bullets, and bold to keep your notes structured and scannable.
  - For narrative uncertainty: Ask Fate Questions with Fate Chart/Check.
  - For twists: Generate Random Events in Meaning Tables; use Event Focus to set the kind of event and roll a word pair for interpretation.
  - For rich detail: Roll on Meaning Tables directly (no Fate question) to flesh out places, objects, or unknown NPCs.

### 3) End the scene: resolution and bookkeeping

Scenes end when the main action resolves, or when the story’s structure naturally shifts (time, location, tone, or focus).

- When to transition:
  - Interest: the key point of interest is concluded
  - Time/Location: you jump time or move to a new place
  - Narrative shift: a dramatic reveal changes the focus
  - Mood: current events feel stale — energize with a fresh scene
  - Automatic Interrupt: stuck? Make the next one an Interrupt to force a Random Event

- End‑of‑scene bookkeeping:
  - Adjust CF: Were you mostly in control (progress) or out of control (setbacks)?
    - In control → CF − 1 (min 1)
    - Out of control → CF + 1 (max 9)
  - Update Lists (Characters/Threads/Features):
    - Add new important entries that emerged
    - Promote relevant items by adding an extra entry (up to three times total)
    - Remove items that are no longer relevant

## App workflow tips

- Keep Scenes short and focused — it makes Fate results easier to interpret and logs easier to review
- Use Meaning Tables right from scene notes when your intuition stalls
- Adjust CF between scenes, not during; snapshot CF at the start of each scene
- Pair a portable notetaking pattern (bullets + sub‑bullets) with inline Fate outcomes for quick skim later
