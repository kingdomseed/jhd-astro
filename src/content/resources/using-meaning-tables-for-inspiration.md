## Guide: Mastering the Meaning Tables module

The Meaning Tables module in the Mythic app is your fast‑access source for inspiration, designed to reduce lookup friction and keep you in story flow. It provides concrete narrative seeds when a simple Yes/No Fate Question isn’t enough.

Layout
- Mobile: Meaning Tables is its own screen. Switch tables and roll with thumb‑friendly controls.
- Desktop: Meaning Tables sits alongside other panels so you can roll and write without switching.

## The purpose of Meaning Tables

Meaning Tables generate descriptive prompts that clarify narrative elements and inject meaning into the adventure.

- Inspirational prompts for details: Use when you want information that doesn’t fit a Yes/No question.
- Pairs well with Fate: Fate answers “does it happen?”; Meaning adds “what does it look like?” or “what’s really going on?”.

## When and how to use the module

You can open Meaning Tables at any time to get a pair of words for inspiration.

### 1) Random Events (Event Meaning)
- Timing: Random Events occur from Fate Check doubles ≤ CF or when an Expected Scene becomes an Interrupt.
- Application: After the Event Focus (e.g., New NPC, PC Negative), roll an Event Meaning word pair (Actions, Descriptions, or Elements). Combine Context + Focus + Meaning to invent the twist.

### 2) Discovering Meaning (adding details)
- Describing the unknown: Define what an object looks like, a character’s background, or what action is taking place in a scene.
- Creating characters: Generate first actions, appearance, background, or identity for a new NPC.
- Starting an adventure: For your First Scene, skip Event Focus and roll word pairs to spark the opener (many use a 4W approach: Who/What/Where/Why using Element tables).
- Clarifying ambiguity: If a Fate or event result feels vague, roll again on Meaning to suggest an angle and narrow the interpretation.
- Altered scenes: If your Expected Scene is Altered and you’re unsure how, roll a word pair to inspire a simple tweak or the next most expected outcome.

## Choosing the right table

Meaning Tables come in three varieties. Picking the best fit often yields the clearest interpretation.

1) Actions: Active verbs — what someone/something is doing or having done to them.
2) Descriptions: Adjectives/qualities — what someone/something looks like or feels like.
3) Elements: Themed sets (e.g., Location, Character, Spell Effects) for more targeted prompts when you want granularity.

## Interpreting the prompts

- Context is key: Let expectations and ongoing context guide your interpretation; whatever you settle on becomes the new fact.
- Embrace abstraction: Words are prompts, not constraints — stretch as needed to land on what makes sense.
- Roll until satisfied: Roll as many times as needed across tables until you have enough input to decide.
- Intensification: If you roll the same Element twice, “double down” on that word — interpret it with greater intensity.
- Connector words: If a pair feels awkward, add “of”, “‑ly”, “and”, or “but” between them to form a useful phrase.

## In the app

- Quick switching: Tap the table type and theme; roll to generate a clear pair of words.
- Copy to notes: On desktop, keep Meaning Tables open while writing scene notes. On mobile, switch back and forth — results are easy to recall.
- Random Events flow: When a twist hits, select Event Focus, then jump here to roll Event Meaning; jot your interpretation in the Scene description.

## Tips

- Use Meaning when you’re stuck translating Fate results into specifics.
- Prefer Elements for targeted, easy‑to‑interpret prompts; use Actions/Descriptions when you want broader sparks.
- Keep your interpretation short and decisive — one sentence is usually enough to push play forward.
