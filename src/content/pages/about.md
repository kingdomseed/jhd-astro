## Profile

### Hi, I'm Jason

I've been building software since 2014 and shipping cross‑platform Flutter apps since 2024. Today I run Jason Holt Digital and—under licence from Word Mill Games—build the official Mythic GME 2e companion apps.

I maintain two products: **Mythic GME Mobile** (iOS, Android) and **Mythic GME Digital** (Windows, macOS, Linux).

I focus on tools that adapt to **your** play style while staying faithful to Mythic GME 2e. That means fast interactions, clear UI, and features you can turn on or off as needed.

I'm also pursuing an M.Sc. in Computational Linguistics to explore practical ways mobile apps and NLP can work together for solo play.

## Official

### Licensed with Word Mill Games

Mythic GME is the oracle I reach for. In 2024 I partnered with Word Mill Games to translate Mythic GME 2e into an accessible, cross‑platform experience shaped by player feedback and hands‑on testing.

* **Core 2e fidelity.** Fate Chart, Fate Check, Random Events, and Scene adjustments implemented with care.
* **Platforms.** Two apps: **Mythic GME Mobile** (iOS, Android) and **Mythic GME Digital** (Windows, macOS, Linux).
* **Portable by design.** Offline‑first, JSON journals, and Markdown exports so your campaigns travel well.
* **Accessible.** Screen‑reader friendly, adjustable type, left‑hand mode, and color‑blind aware palettes.

## Product

### Why Mythic players choose the apps

Mythic GME apps streamline oracle‑style play so you can stay in the story—whether you play solo, run GM‑less groups, or use Mythic as an inspiration engine at home or on the go.

Community feedback directly informs what I ship next—join the Discord to request features and vote on priorities.

## Approach

### What shapes the work

**Grounded principle:** I build in public. I talk with players directly in Discord, share what I shipped each day in #daily-wrap, and release small, frequent updates. I listen to all kinds of feedback and aim for a flexible, faithful Mythic experience across many play styles.

## Connect
