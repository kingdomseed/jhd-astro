# PostHog App Analytics Tracking Plan

Last updated: 2025-08-27

Scope: Native app telemetry only (Flutter). Not website analytics.

## Conventions

- Event names: lower_snake_case, feature_action format (e.g., `log_copy`, `table_roll`).
- Properties: lower_snake_case keys. Booleans when possible; enums as strings.
- Avoid PII. Hash any IDs before sending (stable salt, app-local only).
- Always include common properties below to aid segmentation.

### Common properties to include on all events

- app_version
- build_channel: dev | beta | prod
- platform: iOS | Android | macOS | Windows | Linux | Web
- locale
- current_screen (auto-enriched by AnalyticsService; see Screen names below)
- source_component (optional): button id, widget id
- has_premium_access (if available): true/false
- journal_id_hash (when in a journal context)
- scene_id_hash (when in a scene context)
- table_id_hash (when interacting with a table)
- list_type (when relevant): characters | threads | features
- list_id_hash (if applicable)

Notes:

- Hashing: Prefer SHA-256 with a per-install salt that never leaves the device.
- Distinct ID: Use PostHog distinct_id (stable per install). If you also have an account/user id, set as user property but do not send PII.

## Integration with existing AnalyticsService

- Service: use `lib/core/services/app/analytics_service.dart`; do not create a new analytics service.
- Consent: uses `PreferencesService.getAnalyticsEnabled()` and `posthogToggle(enabled)`.
- Dual logging during sunset: Firebase Analytics remains until fully sunset; PostHog screen capture is live. We'll add PostHog capture for custom events inside `AnalyticsService.logEvent()` so both backends receive events without duplicate instrumentation.
- Error-safety: All analytics calls are wrapped in try/catch within `AnalyticsService`, and UI callers defensively guard calls. If the user disables analytics, `PreferencesService.getAnalyticsEnabled()` ensures PostHog/Firebase calls become no-ops. The app will not crash if analytics are disabled or unavailable.
- Enrichment: `AnalyticsService` auto-adds common properties like `current_screen` and `timestamp` to every event.

### Screen names

- Allowed `screenName` values (from `_getScreenClass`):
  - fate_chart, fate_check
  - meaning_tables
  - custom_tables
  - adventure_lists
  - scenes
  - dice_roller
  - settings
  - premium
  - support

Note: `AnalyticsService` auto-enriches events with `current_screen`. Some helpers also attach `screen`; we will standardize on `current_screen` moving forward.

### Existing event names in service

- feature_usage (params: feature_name, action, ...context)
- dice_roll (params: dice_type, result, context, screen)
- table_usage (params: table_name, table_type, result, screen)
- premium_interaction (params: feature, action, has_access, screen)
- journal_operation (params: operation, journal_id, ...)

### Mapping guidance

- Use existing names when available:
  - Dice Roller â†’ `dice_roll` (extend properties below).
  - General UI taps/toggles can go through `feature_usage` with a clear `feature_name`/`action`.
  - Meaning Tables rolls may remain `table_roll` in PostHog, but can mirror to Firebase as `table_usage`.

## Derived metrics and dashboards (examples)

- Adoption: % users who used Features list; % who edited a built-in table; % who used saved formulas
- Engagement: median scenes per journal; average list rolls per session; dice rolls per session
- Feature usage: distribution of dice expression complexity; top tables rolled; top settings changed
- Funnels: new user â†’ first scene â†’ first roll â†’ first custom table

## Implementation notes

- Centralize tracking in an Analytics service to keep UI clean and unit-testable
- Emit events from Notifiers/ViewModels for state changes; from Widgets for pure UI actions
- Guard with analytics opt-in and platform checks
- Batch context-specific IDs using hashed values only

## Open questions to confirm

1) Enumerate concrete setting_key values to track (full list)
2) Confirm ability to detect paste vs typed in Scenes (platform text field hooks)
3) Confirm max list expand target (25) and all list_types in scope
4) Define `adjustment_type` taxonomy for scene adjustments
5) Support: additional links/actions can be added later (e.g., GitHub/issues) â€” taxonomy above already accounts for these.

## Next steps

1. QA Support screen events in dev: verify `support_opened`, `support_link_clicked(link_id)`, `support_action(rate_app)` in PostHog with correct `current_screen`.
2. QA Settings screen events in dev: verify `settings_opened` and `setting_changed(setting_key, from_value, to_value, changed_in)` in PostHog with correct `current_screen`.
3. QA Dice Roller events in dev: verify `dice_roll` and `dice_roll_error` with properties above; confirm `current_screen` enrichment and consent behavior.
4. Instrument Meaning Tables: `table_search`, `table_tap`, `table_roll`, `roll_result_interaction`.
5. Define dashboards: adoption, engagement, key funnels; add Support usage metrics.
6. Run end-to-end QA: confirm consent toggles result in no-ops, verify error-safety across platforms.
