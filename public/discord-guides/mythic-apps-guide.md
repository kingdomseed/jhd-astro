Mythic Apps keep solo/co‑op play simple: start at the Fate Chart, set your Chaos Factor (CF), ask a yes/no question, roll, and jot a note. Use Lists (Characters/Threads/Features) to track story elements, Meaning Tables for inspiration and interpretation, and Scenes to summarize what happened. No accounts—everything is on‑device.

Install & first launch
- Install from your store and open the app. On first launch the app creates your first journal (you can rename it later in Settings).

What you need
- Your favorite RPG and character(s) created (keep sheets handy)
- The Mythic GME 2e book for odds and rules context
- The app installed on your device(s)

Quick flow
1) Set Chaos Factor (CF) on the Fate Chart.
2) Ask a yes/no question → choose odds → roll. Record the outcome with a one‑line interpretation.
3) Maintain Lists as ideas emerge. Typically seed Characters and Threads at your starting point:
   - Threads are your goals/plotlines.
   - Characters include PCs, NPCs, factions—and even notable items (e.g., a named sword).
4) Optional: pre‑write your expected scene (one or two lines) to clarify what you think will happen. This allows you to challenge expectations.
5) When the scene ends (bookkeeping): create/update a Scene entry with a short title + summary, and record the CF you started the scene with.
6) Adjust CF: down if you were in control; up if chaos hit.

Navigation
- Mobile: panels are separate screens; open the side menu (drawer) to switch.
- Desktop: core panels are visible together so you can roll and write without switching.

Tips
- Unsure about odds? Start with Likely or 50/50 and refine over time.
- If you feel stuck mid‑scene, roll on Meaning Tables and write a quick interpretation.
