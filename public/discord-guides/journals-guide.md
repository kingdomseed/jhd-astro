# Shorter
A Mythic GME app journal is like a saved game that stores all of your adventures logs, Scenes, and List data. You can easily create or switch to a new journal in the Settings -> Files section of the app. You can also import journals and export journals from this screen. A template is attached here for those who want to understand, modify, or build journals outside of the app for use in the app or other apps. 

# Longer
Mythic GME app's journal files are like saved games that store all of your adventure's logs, scenes, and lists. The app uses a structured text file format called JSON to organize this data. 

Each adventure's data is self-contained. You can create new adventures by going to Settings -> Files and using the create button there. You can also rename journals, import journals, and export journals. 

For those who want to build or modify journal data outside of the app, I am including the schema, template, and example files below. You could also use these to build an integration for another app if you are into that kind of thing.
