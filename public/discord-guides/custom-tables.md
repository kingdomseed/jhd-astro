Custom Tables let you create your own rollable tables/oracles for any RPG.

Where it lives
- Mobile (Apple/Google/Amazon): unlock once (one‑time IAP), then open the Custom Tables item in the app menu.
- Desktop (Microsoft Store, itch.io): included (no IAP). Use the bottom‑right toolbar (four icons) and click the Custom Tables icon (just above the Dice Roller).

What you can build
- Rollable tables for encounters, loot, reactions, events, terrain, NPC traits—anything you want to roll on.
- Two table types (Meaning / Event Focus) map to app features, but use them however your table needs.
- Categories: group tables and set icons for tidy browsing.
- Import/Export: share as CSV/TXT/PSV/JSON or bring in community packs.

How to start
1) Open Custom Tables → New → Table (Meaning or Event Focus).
2) Give it a name, pick (or create) a Category, set a range (start small like 1–10), and fill entries to cover the full range with no gaps/overlaps.
3) Save and roll to test. Tweak as you go.

Tips
- Start with small ranges (d6/d10) and grow later.
- Keep ranges continuous—no gaps/overlaps (the app validates this for you).
- Use roll‑ons to chain a result to another table or to your Lists.
- Tables can be linked together (or nested).
- You can link tables at the table level--rolling on one table rolls on the other as well.
- You can also link tables at the entry level--rolling on an entry in the table rolls on the table that is linked to that entry.
- Recursive rolls are limited to 10. 

Import/Export
- Import from CSV/TXT/PSV/JSON via the Import/Export tab.
- Export your creations to share with friends or back up.
